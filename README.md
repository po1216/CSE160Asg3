### Objective:
To create a virtual world using textured cubes and explore it using a perspective camera.

### Descriptions:
- The ground is created with a large brown plane.
- The sky is created with a very large blue cube.
- The size of the world layout is 32x32. Some objects are taller than 4 cubes.

### Additional features beyond the basics:
- You can rotate the camera with mouse. You can also control the perspective (FOV, specficially) using either the mouse wheel or the slider. There are extra control features implemented as well, such as going up or looking up.
- There are multiple textures.
- There is a simply story added to my world: finding one of the puppies. Shift+click him if you found one!
- Performance has no issue on my machine, without a hardware acceleration on Google Chrome. FPS usually stays at 200s.
